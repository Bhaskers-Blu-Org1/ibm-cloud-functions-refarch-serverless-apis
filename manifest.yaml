#   Action:     data-processing-message-hub/receive-consume
#   Action:     data-processing-message-hub/transform-produce
#   Sequence:   data-processing-message-hub/message-processing-sequence
#   Trigger:    message-trigger
#   Rule:       message-rule

# This manifest file expects following env. variables:
#   KAFKA_INSTANCE
#   SRC_TOPIC
#   DEST_TOPIC
