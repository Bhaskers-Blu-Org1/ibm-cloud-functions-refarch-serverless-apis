# Deploy using IBM Continuous Delivery

This deployment approach clones this repository into your own GitHub namespace and sets up an IBM Continuous Delivery toolchain that redeploys your application each time changes are pushed to your clone.

Use the following button to clone a copy of this repository and deploy to the IBM Cloud as part of a DevOps toolchain.

Supply your IBM Cloud Functions API key and Message Hub credentials under the Delivery Pipeline icon, click Create, then run the Deploy stage in the Delivery Pipeline.

You can then automatically redeploy changes by pushing changes to your cloned repository.
